# Application programming interface
This package provides a single function, `where()`, allowing to locate a command in the system path:

```dart
import 'package:where/where.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  try {
    // `path` is the absolute path to the executable.
    final path = await where('foobar');
    print('The command "foobar" is located at: $path');
  }

  on FinderException catch (err) {
    print('The command "${err.command}" is not found');
  }
}
```

The function returns a [`Future<String>`](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-async/Future-class.html) that completes with the absolute path of the first instance of the executables found. If the command could not be located, the future completes with a `FinderException`.

## Options
The behavior of the `where()` function can be customized using the following optional named parameters.

### bool **all**
A value indicating whether to return all executables found, instead of just the first one.

If you pass `true` as parameter value, the function will return a `Future<List<String>>` providing all paths found, instead of a `Future<String>`:

```dart
import 'package:where/where.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final paths = await where('foobar', all: true);
  print('The command "foobar" was found at these locations:');
  for (final path in paths) print(path);
}
```

### String | List&lt;String&gt; **extensions**
The executable file extensions, provided as a string or a list of file extensions. Defaults to the list of extensions provided by the `PATHEXT` environment variable.

```dart
where('foobar', extensions: '.FOO;.EXE;.CMD');
where('foobar', extensions: ['.foo', '.exe', '.cmd']);
```

!!! tip
    The `extensions` option is only meaningful on the Windows platform,
    where the executability of a file is determined from its extension.

### dynamic **onError**(String command)
By default, when the specified command cannot be located, a `FinderException` is thrown. You can disable this exception by providing your own error handler:

```dart
import 'package:where/where.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final path = await where('foobar', onError: (command) => '');
  if (path.isEmpty) print('The command "foobar" was not found');
  else print('The command "foobar" is located at: $path');
}
```

When an `onError` handler is provided, it is called with the command as argument, and its return value is used instead. This is preferable to throwing and then immediately catching the `FinderException`.

### String | List&lt;String&gt; **path**
The system path, provided as a string or a list of directories. Defaults to the list of paths provided by the `PATH` environment variable.

```dart
where('foobar', path: '/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin');
where('foobar', path: ['/usr/local/bin', '/usr/bin']);
```

### String **pathSeparator**
The character used to separate paths in the system path. Defaults to the platform path separator (i.e. `";"` on Windows, `":"` on other platforms).

```dart
where('foobar', pathSeparator: '#');
// For example: "/usr/local/bin#/usr/bin"
```
