# Installation

## Requirements
Before installing **Where.dart**, you need to make sure you have the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/tools/sdk)
and [Pub](https://dart.dev/tools/pub), the Dart package manager, up and running.

!!! warning
    Where.dart requires Dart >= **2.7.0**.

You can verify if you're already good to go with the following commands:

```shell
dart --version
# Dart VM version: 2.7.2 (Mon Mar 23 22:11:27 2020 +0100) on "windows_x64"

pub --version
# Pub 2.7.2
```

!!! info
    If you plan to play with the package sources, you will also need
    [Grinder](https://pub.dev/packages/grinder) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material).

## Installing with Pub package manager

### 1. Depend on it
Add this to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  where: *
```

### 2. Install it
Install this package and its dependencies from a command prompt:

```shell
pub get
```

### 3. Import it
Now in your [Dart](https://dart.dev) code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:where/where.dart';
```
