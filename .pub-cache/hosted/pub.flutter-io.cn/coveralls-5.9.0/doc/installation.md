# Installation

## Requirements
Before installing **Coveralls for Dart**, you need to make sure you have the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/tools/sdk)
and [Pub](https://dart.dev/tools/pub), the Dart package manager, up and running.

You can verify if you're already good to go with the following commands:

``` shell
dart --version
# Dart VM version: 2.8.3 (stable) (Tue May 26 18:39:38 2020 +0200) on "windows_x64"

pub --version
# Pub 2.8.3
```

!!! info
	If you plan to play with the package sources, you will also need
	[PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material).

## Installing with Pub package manager

### 1. Depend on it
Add this to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

``` yaml
dependencies:
	coveralls: *
```

### 2. Install it
Install this package and its dependencies from a command prompt:

``` shell
pub get
```

### 3. Import it
Now in your [Dart](https://dart.dev) code, you can use:

``` dart
import "package:coveralls/coveralls.dart";
```
